# COVID-19-Highest-Number-Of-Cases

### As cases rise, so does risk of infection. 

What counties in the United States are most at risk for a growth in COVID-19 cases? Since this virus is spread through contact, it is likely that areas with the highest number of cases will have the highest risk for further growth of COVID-19.

Below is a simple Bar Graph that enumerates the US counties with highest number of cases in a single day:

![newplot(5) ](https://github.com/rreed24/COVID-19-Highest-Number-Of-Cases/blob/master/images/newplot%20(5).png)

1.) Nassau, New York; 2.) Suffolk, New York; 3.) Cook, Illinois; and 4.) Westchester, New York are the four US Counties that see the highest number of COVID-19 Cases in a Day.

The bubble map below confirms this data as you can see the largest bubble is in the New York area:

The United States is seeing the highest (and fastest) growth of COVID-19 in areas that have a large number of people in one area. Strict stay-at-home orders must be enforced in these areas until a successful treatment is found. The notebook attached to this repository explores the growth of COVID-19 further through a Density Heat Map and a Choropleth Map.
